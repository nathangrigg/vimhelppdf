A script to convert Vim documentation to hyperlinked PDF, using LaTeX

# Vim documentation in PDF format

These scripts create a PDF document containing the documentation that ships
with Vim, as well as the Vim FAQ. The resulting file is more than 2,500 pages
of hyperlinked, colorful PDF.

The resulting PDF file can be downloaded at <http://nathangrigg.net/vimhelp/>

The text to LaTeX conversion script, along with linking and highlighting,
are based on the text to html conversion script written by
[Carlo Teubner](http://github.com/c4rlo/vimhelp).

# Building the PDF

The PDF can be generated by running `make`. The automatic build script requires
`git` and `xelatex`. It also uses some fonts that you may not have
installed on your computer. You can edit `preamble.tex` to get around this.

The `contents.txt` file can be used to reorder the text files in the pdf
or eliminate some entirely. Note that any links into text files that
are removed will break.

The default `make` command makes a US letter sized PDF. You may also run `make
a4` or `make ipad` for different PDF sizes.

Latex requires multiple runs for things like generating the table of contents.
You will have to run `make` twice for everything to work right. For this
reason, running `make` with a PDF target will always run LaTeX, even
if everything appears to be up to date.

Running `make update` will download the newest version of the Vim
documentation.
